Why do people worry more about shark attacks than falling coconuts, when the latter is statistically more deadly? The answer may lie in a cognitive shortcut known as the **availability heuristic**. This mental bias describes our tendency to rely on information that comes to mind quickly and easily when making decisions or judgments about the world.

First proposed by psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, the availability heuristic explains that if you can recall instances of an event with little effort, you are likely to believe that event is more common or more likely to occur than it actually is. Vivid, dramatic, and heavily reported events—like plane crashes, lottery wins, or shark attacks—stick in our minds. This mental availability leads us to overestimate their frequency.

"The media plays a significant role in this," explains cognitive psychologist Dr. Ben Carter. "Constant news coverage of a particular type of event makes it highly 'available' in our memory. Our brain then makes the logical leap to assume that if it's easy to remember, it must be common. It's a useful shortcut in many situations, but it can lead to significant errors in risk assessment."

Understanding this bias is the first step toward mitigating it. By consciously seeking out statistical data and considering less dramatic, but more common, occurrences, we can make more rational decisions and align our fears more closely with reality.
